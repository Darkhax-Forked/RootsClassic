  "1.12.2":{
	"1.0.0":"Initial Release"
	,"1.0.1":"Clicking a Mortar recipe now displays it in chat as a helpful reminder.  Fixed particle transparency.  Added forge update checker hook.  Added in-game Config GUI setup; 1.0.0 config file is no longer compatible, (suggested you delete config from 1.0.0 to avoid duplicate entries.  This will not happen again in future releases).  Added tooltips to a few items.   Casting Altar now correctly triggers from player sneak-activating, and gives warning message if ritual invalid.  Fixed some berries not having a use.  Living tools now use gold nugget instead of ingot.  Berries now drop from all six vanilla tree leaves not just oak.  "
  	,"1.0.2":"Infernal bulbs no longer get eaten when used on a skeleton.  Removed restriction of Crystal Staff only working on vanilla grass blocks.   More config controls added.  You can now remove items from the mortar using an empty hand.  Mortar gives you a status message if recipe is invalid.   Fixed a crash when a Staff runs out of durability.  Fixed Devil's Flower spell not spawning a skeleton.    "
  	,"1.0.3":"Fixed a startup crash compatibility issue with ERZ.  "
  	,"1.1.0":"Status messages while setting up rituals for ease of use.  Ritual ingredients are now unique.  If your ritual is invalid, you get status-bar messages to get a better idea of what is missing.  When you start a ritual, if all ingredients are valid it will auto-light the braziers for you.  "
