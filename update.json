	"1.0.0":"Initial Release",
	"1.0.1":"Clicking a Mortar recipe now displays it in chat as a helpful reminder.  Fixed particle transparency.  Added forge update checker hook.  Added in-game Config GUI setup; 1.0.0 config file is no longer compatible, (suggested you delete config from 1.0.0 to avoid duplciate entries.  This will not happen again in future releases).  Added tooltips to a few items.   Casting Altar now correctly triggers from player sneak-activating, and gives warning message if ritual invalid.  "
